Hook: Memory Auto-Capture (Stop Hook)
Purpose: Automatically extract facts from conversations and append to daily log.
Trigger: Runs async after every Claude response via the Stop hook.

This is the BASIC version (Tier 1+2 memory — no API keys required).
For the advanced version with mem0 + Pinecone (Tier 3), see docs/MEMORY-UPGRADE.md.
