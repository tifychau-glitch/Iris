# Guardrails

Safety rules that apply across all skills and sessions.

## Destructive Actions
- Never delete files, databases, or resources without explicit user confirmation
- Never run `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, or `git reset --hard` without confirmation
- Never drop database tables without confirmation
- Preserve intermediate outputs before retrying failed workflows

## Security
- Never expose API keys, tokens, or credentials in output
- Never commit .env files or credentials to git
- Never log sensitive data to daily logs or MEMORY.md

## External Communications
- Never send emails, Slack messages, or any external communication without user confirmation
- Never post to social media without user review and approval
- Never make API calls that create, modify, or delete external resources without confirmation

## Data Integrity
- Verify script output format before chaining into another script
- Don't assume APIs support batch operations — check documentation first
- When a workflow fails mid-execution, preserve intermediate outputs before retrying
- When uncertain about intent, ask rather than guess
